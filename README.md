# iForget

We developers always have a lot of stuff in our mind so it's easy to forget something while stepping away from our desk. Easy things to forget like wallet, commute card etc.. It opten happens to me. So, I came up with a solution. I want my iPhone let me know about the things that I might forgot just after I leave my room. I can use iPhone's built in reminders's "when leave the location" feature but that's gonna alert me quite far away from the home. 

So, I built an app for that and also for educational purpose.
